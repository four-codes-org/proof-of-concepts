You need to upload your PGP public key to Ubuntuâ€™s key server so that it can be downloaded by anyone. Run the following command for it. Replace 1024D/D8EC56D2 2005-09-08 with the pub id of your key pair.

```bash
gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --send-keys 1024D/D8EC56D2 2005-09-08
```

If you want to simply export the key to another person run the following command. Replace admin@example.com with the email address you have used in step 2. 

```bash
gpg --armor --export admin@example.com > public_key.asc
```

Now you may send public_key.asc file to others. If you want to export the key to a readable text file, you may also run the following command.

```bash
gpg --armor --output key.txt --export admin@example.com
```

Now you may send the key.txt to others.
